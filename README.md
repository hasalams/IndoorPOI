# Indoor Points of Interest (POI)

Points of Interest for a smartphone user is extracted using GPS data when the user is in an outdoor environment. When the user enters an indoor environment, the GPS singal quality is poor and hence, identifying indoor points of interests becomes a challege.

Therefore, we propose a technique to extract indoor points of interests based on surrounding WiFi access point (AP) information. 
We utilize a smartphone applicaition to scan the surrrounding WiFi AP information such as MAC address and respective received signal strength (RSS) for each AP.

The detailed information are available in the following research paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8851651 (Published in the 16th IEEE VTS Asia Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (APWCS) at Singapore University of Technology and Design in Singapore, August 28-30, 2019)
